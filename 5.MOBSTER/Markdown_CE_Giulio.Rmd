Our analyses mainly leverage on a set packages that I have developed. Follow the links to see the package websites, function manuals and reference vignettes (these analyses are largely based on the vignettes).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Requirements <a name="req"></a> 

We assume that you have run the setup script that we circulated, which we replicate here below. Notice that we have tested this with the new R version 3.4 (released this summer).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# These commands have been successfully tested on this system
# 
# >  sessionInfo()
# R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)
# Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)
# Running under: macOS Catalina 10.15.7
# 
# Run on 20/4/2021.

# Devtools is required to install packages from Github directly, you should
# already have it (unless you've downloaded a brand new R version)
install.packages('devtools')

# We use these two packages in this tutorial. They will download automatically
# all the required dependencies, some of them are also my packages, but many
# of them are pretty standard CRAN packages. Reply Yes to any question regarding
# the installation of extra packages, and installation by binary (rather than 
# sources) works as well.

# Get the MOBSTER tool for subclonal deconvolution, and CNAqc for data QC
devtools::install_github("caravagn/mobster", ref = 'development')
devtools::install_github("caravagn/CNAqc")
devtools::install_github("caravagn/ctree")

# Extra package(s) that we need to include in the packages as dependencies
install.packages('wesanderson')
install.packages('reshape2')
install.packages('ggpubr')
```

```{r}
# This should now work
library(mobster)
library(CNAqc)
library(tidyverse)
```
So you can load the libraries that are required for this analysis, and everything should go just fine.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(mobster)
library(CNAqc)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Input data <a name="input"></a>

We use some data that [we have recently analysed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0675-5); there are more data
release with our paper, you could play around with those once you have understood this analysis. 

> Subclonal reconstruction of tumors by using machine learning and population genetics
Caravagna et al. Nature Genetics volume 52, pages 898â€“907 (2020).

For these data we have selected the following:

* single-nucleotide somatic mutations;
* absolute clonal CNA segments;
* tumour purity. 

The data have been cleaned by me for this presentation (similarly to how I did that for the actual paper). Originally, this sample and its associated relapse have been released with a [Cancer Cell paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30905762/)

> Evolutionary Trajectories of IDH WT Glioblastomas Reveal a Common Path of Early Tumorigenesis Instigated Years ahead of Initial Diagnosis. Koerber et al. Cancer Cell. 2019 Apr 15;35(4):692-704.e12. 

Inputs are provided in CSV format, we load them using the `readr` package.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# -> somatic mutations
snvs = readr::read_csv('data/mutations.csv', col_types = readr::cols())

# -> copy number segment (CNA), precisely absolute calls for clonal segments
cna = readr::read_csv('data/cna.csv', col_types = readr::cols())

# Sample information
sample_info = readr::read_csv('data/sample.csv', col_types = readr::cols())

# -> sample id
sample_id = sample_info$sample

# -> a scalar reporting sample purity (0 <= x <= 1)
sample_purity = sample_info$purity

# -> reference genome used
reference = "hg19"
```

`readr` returns all tibble-compliant data, using the `tidyverse` approach. Let's have a look at what we have in the data. To map mutations on top of CNA we need to have genome locations, and to run a deconvolution with MOBSTER we need the VAF of the somatic mutation. Note that these calls are obtained by subtracting the somatic mutations detected in the tumour sample from a putative normal sample.

```{r}
print(snvs)
```

For instance we see:

* `chr` - chromosome name (format `chrXX`)
* `from`/ `to` - nucleotide position (relative to the chromosome beginning)
* `ref`/ `alt` - reference and alternative allele

These mutations span all the genome and are just SNVs (it is good to use these instead of indels). 
```{r}
 # Mapping of the mutations per chromosome
snvs %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(chr) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n()) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(n))

# Type of mutations
snvs %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(ref, alt) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n()) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(n)) 
```

We also have read counts data obtained from the caller that was used to generate. You can verify that 
`VAF` = `NV`/`DP`. Eg, 6/60 = 0.1

```{r}
snvs %>% 
  dplyr::select(DP, NV, VAF) %>% 
  print
```

Before moving on, notice that there are driver mutations annotated in these calls; one for instance is
an exonic `TP53` mutation - identified after Annovar annotations by looking at [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).
This driver has been discovered by the authors in the original paper. Another driver event has been retrieved from the original paper, it is a `TERT` promoter mutation (other potential drivers are annotated in the original paper but the fall off CNA regions, and so are not discussed here).

The input format to include drivers is the one required by `CNAqc`.

```{r}
snvs %>% 
  dplyr::filter(is_driver) %>% 
  print
```


# Assessing the quality of these calls <a name="quality"></a>

We use the package [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc/). 

The package takes as input all the data we have just loaded, and maps the mutations on top of the
segments. it implements also a number of other analyses which we will see right now.

The idea of `CNAqc` is this. If we have a godd normal/ tumour set of samples, mutations are 
somewhat easier to call compared to CNAs. This is because mutations are associated to read counts,
which come out of a BAM file, while CNAs are from BAF and log-ratio data. The same holds
for sample purity estimate, which is usually obtained together with CNAs.

Thus, in general  _if mutations calls are "good" quality,_ then we can assess the quality of CNAs 
and tumour purity estimates as well. Basically the two types of data - mutations on one side,
and CNAs/prity on the other - cannot tell two different stories.

We begin by creating a `CNAqc` S3 object (read out the outputs of the tool to understand
what is happening).
```{r}
# CNAqc data object
x = CNAqc::init(snvs,
                cna,
                sample_purity,
                reference)

# S3 print
print(x)
```

There are some basic plotting functions in the package, you shoud use those to
inspect the included mutations.

In general we are interested in the `VAF` and `DP` profiles - recall that `DP` is the
coverage per locus. We assemble a nice 2-panels figure by using `ggpubr`; note that
the package also annotates the driver data in the plot, so you can immediately see
that this `TP53` driver SNVs maps to an LOH region (kind of expected for a suppressor gene).

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggpubr::ggarrange(
  CNAqc::plot_data_histogram(x),
  CNAqc::plot_data_histogram(x, which = 'DP'),
  ncol = 2
  ) %>% 
  print()
```


We can do more complex plots. For instace we can layout a panel with segments in bottom, 
and all other genome-wide plots on top. Via `cowplot` we can align plots on the vertical axis, 
and stretch their relative height to obtain a nice layout.

```{r, fig.width=9.5, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=F}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  CNAqc::plot_gw_counts(x),
  CNAqc::plot_gw_vaf(x, N = 10000),
  CNAqc::plot_gw_depth(x, N = 10000),
  CNAqc::plot_segments(x),
  align = 'v', 
  nrow = 4, 
  rel_heights = c(.15, .15, .15, .8)
  )
```

So it is easy to see that this tumour is largely diploid
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=4}
CNAqc::plot_karyotypes(x)
```

You can play around with the `CNAqc` functions following examples available at the tool website.

Here we just check that the quality of the calls is good to study this tumour. We use a method based on a peak
detection algorithm that is derived from a combinatorial arguments that links tumour ploidy, mutation multiplicity,
sample purity, and VAF.

We do not dig into the details of this, you can fin a lot of explanations on the manual and tool website. 

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
x = CNAqc::analyze_peaks(x, matching_strategy = 'closest')

print(x)
```


We can visualise the result of this analysis.
```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
CNAqc::plot_peaks_analysis(x)
```

# Subclonal deconvolution of diploid SNVs <a name="diploid"></a>

We use the package [mobster](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster/). 

Now we know we can trust those diploid SNVs, let's use them.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Subset the data
diploid_mutations = x %>%
  CNAqc::subset_by_segment_karyotype(karyotypes = '1:1')

# We can visualise the data using ggplot
diploid_mutations$snvs %>%
  ggplot(aes(VAF)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  theme_light()
```

We use SNVs with `VAF` above $5\%$, and below $65\%$; SNVs above that cut 
are clearly given by miscalled CNA segments.

We use one possible parametrisation of `mobster`, which is identified by
a `"FAST"`. This tests a few model parameters, and is usually fast to run; It is not necessarily the best 
analysis but in general is good enough to get a quick grasp of what is in the data. In this case it works
well.

```{r}
mobster_analysis = mobster_fit(
  diploid_mutations$snvs %>%
    dplyr::filter(VAF > 0.05, VAF < 0.65),  # Remove minimum VAF and obviously wrong mappings
  seed = 1234,
  auto_setup = "FAST",
  description = sample_id
  )

```

Function `mobster_fit` returns a composite object (which we will soon wrap up in a new S3 object). So far you
can see the fields returned by the tool in a named list.

The list contains:

* the best model fits;
* a set of alternative model fits;
* a table with all the scored models.

```{r}
# Named list
names(mobster_analysis)

# A table reporting the score for each possible model returned by the tool
print(mobster_analysis$fits.table)

# The scoring used (defined in the paper): default reICL (~BIC + entropy of the latent variables)
print(mobster_analysis$model.selection)

# The best model fit -- what you will consider most of the times for downstream analysis
print(mobster_analysis$best)
```

The first thing to do now, is to plot the best model fit, and inspect it.
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, warning = FALSE}
plot(mobster_analysis$best)
```

Then, we can inspect a number of other features for the model, using other
plotting functions of `mobster`. You should read the model definition to understand
exactly what these plot means.

We can see the probability of assignment of a mutation to a cluster, and use it to
check if some clusters are more difficult to define than others.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot_latent_variables(mobster_analysis$best)
```

Then we can see how big is each cluster (normalised for total mutational burden).
In clustering these are called mixing proportions.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, warning = FALSE}
plot_mixing_proportions(mobster_analysis$best)
```

The model minimises a negative log-likelihood function, which we can
visualise (as a function of the optimisation step).

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
plot_NLL(mobster_analysis$best)
```

In general it is also good to inspect the other models that we have selected
as alternative to the best fit. 

In this case we see that the only model that makes sense is the best one.

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_model_selection(mobster_analysis)
```

The theory underlying `mobster` allows to retrieve the evolutionary parameters of this tumour, such as:

* the tumour mutation rate $\mu$ (in units of cell doublings);
* the time the subclone originated (same unit as above);
* the subclone selection coefficient $s$.

```{r}
evolutionary_parameters(mobster_analysis)
```

# Subclonal deconvolution with CCF <a name="ccf"></a>

We can also compute CCFs from these calls, because they are good quality. If everything
makes sense, we should obtain the same result we have with diploid mutations.

We go back to using `CNAqc` to compute CCFs values, and plot their analysis. Details
on how the computation is carried out are available at the package website. Shortly,
it uses an entropy measure based on a mixture model for the expected peaks of 
mutations multiplicities.

```{r,fig.width=11, fig.height=10,warning=F}
x = CNAqc::compute_CCF(x, method = "ENTROPY")

# We can visualise the CCF computation report
plot_CCF(x)
```

So we have the overall CCF distribution now.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# CCF across all karyotypes
plot_data_histogram(x, which = 'CCF')
```

The CCFs are used to create a valid input for `mobster`. We rescale the CCF
value to match a VAF for a putative heterozygous clonal diploid mutation.

We go faster: we impose filters as above (adjusted for purity), fit the model
and 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, warning = FALSE}
# Getter and filter
ccf_input = CCF(x) %>%
  mutate(VAF = CCF/2) %>%
  filter(VAF > 0.05/0.95, VAF < 1)

# Actual run, as above
mobster_analysis_CCF = mobster_fit(
  ccf_input, 
  auto_setup = 'FAST', 
  description = sample_id
  )

# We just go faster than before
plot(mobster_analysis_CCF$best)
```

We use the package [ctree](https://caravagn.github.io/ctree/) to cpmpute clone trees from these CCF clusters.

This package is accessed directly from `mobster`. With 1 sunclone, there is one possible tree (obviously).


```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, warning = FALSE}
trees = mobster::get_clone_trees(mobster_analysis_CCF$best)

# Textual print
print(trees)

# Plot the unique tree
plot(trees[[1]])
```
