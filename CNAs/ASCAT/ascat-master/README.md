## Allele-Specific Copy Number Analysis of Tumors

### Description

This repository provides the ASCAT R package that can be used to infer tumour purity, ploidy and
allele-specific copy number profiles.

ASCAT is described in detail in [“Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors” Van Loo et al. PNAS 107(39): 16910-5 (2010)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837533).

This repository also contains the code underlying additional publications:
["Allele-specific multi-sample copy number segmentation" Ross, Haase, Van Loo, Markowetz. bioRxiv (2017)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/166017v1).
